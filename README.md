#### Lina Teichmann, Denise Moerel, Chris Baker, Tijl Grootswagers

This repository contains all code for the paper "An empirically-driven guide on using Bayes Factors for M/EEG decoding" available here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.23.449663v3.abstract 

To calculate Bayes Factors for your own time-series decoding data, download the matlab function "BFF_repo/codes/local_functions/bayesfactor_R_wrapper.m" (based on BayesFactor R package, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesFactor/BayesFactor.pdf) or "BFF_repo/codes/local_functions/bayesfactor.m" (pure matlab version). We also uploaded an example of how to use Python instead of Matlab here "BFF_repo/codes/BF_colour_python.ipynb".
